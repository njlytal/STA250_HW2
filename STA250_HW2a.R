# STA 250 HW 2 - METHOD 1: Clustering in R

# among the clusters

# Once the files are selected, we must create a function
# that reads their contents and outputs the individual
# delay values. It must account for the two file formats.

# Compare:
# OLD FREQ TABLE: (6.5665, 0, 31.5563), time(610.358, 24.485, 431.815)
# clusterApply: (6.566486, 0, 31.555595), time(107.533, 7.204, 331.719) 
# clusterApplyLB: (6.566486, 0, 31.555595), time(107.984, 11.744, 267.892) 

# clusterApplyLb takes 5/8 the time of original method to complete.
# Better but not ideal yet. In a perfect world, would cut
# down to <1/3, but this requires the table construction
# to be parallelized.
# I can get lists of frequency tables in delays(), BUT I
# haven't refined a way to combine them smoothly yet.
# Currently exploring options in STA250_HW2Notes.R

# Currently, gain is noticeable but NOT as big as expected.
# Mainly, this is because the table construction itself is
# as of yet NOT parallelized, and takes up a couple minutes
# of computing time. Furthermore, the files are NOT balanced
# in an ideal fashion -- the first node has the 20 biggest files
# compared to the 60 smaller ones on the other nodes. Thankfully,
# clusterApplyLB improves this noticeably by allocating files to
# nodes as they become free.
